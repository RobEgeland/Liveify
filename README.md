# Liveify

## What is Liveify?

Liveify is an all in one destination to share and upload all of the Concerts and Artists you have seen. Like an online scrapbook!

## How it works
Liveify allows you to create, update, and delete concerts from your user page allong with the assocotated artists from each concert.

## Getting up and Running
Once you [**Fork and clone**] the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RobEgeland/Liveify.git
```

The Rake commands have already been set up for you all you need to is to type 

```bash
rake server
```

and your backend is ready to go.
